This is a library for Java where you can find different numeric methods to use out of the box. It was college project wich I decided to share so that other users can also add new things.

###Methods you can find
* Bisection (roots)
* Newton-Raphson (roots)
* Romberg (Definite Integrals)
* RungeKutta (differential equations)
* Adams-Bashforth (differential equations)
* Adams-Moulton (differential equations)

###Interpolators you can find
* Cubic Spline
* Newton Interpolation
* Linear Interpolation

###Credits
